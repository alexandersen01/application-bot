Dear whomever it may concern.
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Summer Internship with Pareto Securities. As a second-year student studying Informatics, Mathematics, and Economics at the University of Bergen, I consider myself an academic Swiss-army knife. I am eager to contribute my analytical skills and gain valuable insight and experience from one of the leading investment banks in the Nordic region.
The prospect of working closely with experienced colleagues and being involved in equity research at Pareto Securities is particularly appealing to me. The reason as to why Iâ€™d like to work in ER is because of my interest in data wrangling and analysis. This is also the reason why I, unlike the vast majority of your applicants, study Informatics and Mathematics alongside Economics instead of pure economics.
I believe that my dedication, analytical aptitude, and commitment to excellence, complemented by my ability to approach problems from multiple perspectives, make me a promising candidate for the internship.
For instance, in my personal and academic programming projects, I have consistently demonstrated a keen attention to detail and a knack for problem-solving. Through careful analysis and a systematic approach, I have been able to develop efficient solutions to complex programming challenges. Moreover, my ability to think critically and apply logical reasoning has allowed me to grasp intricate concepts quickly, enabling me to tackle diverse problems with confidence.
In addition to my programming skills, I have a solid foundation in various areas that are valuable. This includes a strong understanding of mathematical principles that I can apply when working on data analysis or in a valuation context. By leveraging these skills, I can contribute to the team's goals and deliver high-quality results.
I am excited about the possibility of joining Pareto Securities as a Summer Intern as an equity analyst and contributing to the success of your esteemed organization. I have attached my resume for your review, and I look forward to the opportunity of discussing my application further.
